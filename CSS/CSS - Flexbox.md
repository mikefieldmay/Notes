##Â Working with Flexbox - The modern wat to change the way our elements are displayed
There are 3 main components of flexbox:
- The Flex-Container
- Main Axis vs Cross Axis
- The flex Items

### Why use Flexbox

Flex items can be a good way to position stuff rather than using inline-block. It also lets us more easily manipulate items without having to use hardcoded widths and values. It allows us to remove display: inline-block from our code. It makes our code leaner, more efficient and easier to read.

### Understanding Flexbox

Flexbox allows us to change the way our elements are displayed. The property that allows us to use flexbox is the `display: flex` property. This creates a flex container which is the parent of our flex items. When the parent has become a flex container. Properties that the flex container has access to are:
- flex-flow
- justify-conent
- align-content
- align-items

Flex item properties include:
- order
- flex 
- aign-self
