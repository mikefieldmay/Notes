# What is Flutter?

Flutter is a SDK for developing 2d mobile applications. It is built in the programming language Dart. Flutter is a framework for Dart. It ships with a a large amounts of UI widgets. You write using one language (which can be customised for different Platforms). It also give you build and publish tools. It is both the framework and the tools. 

## Flutter architecture

Flutter works with Widgets (similar to React or Angular components). A Flutter app is just a tree of widgets. Flutter embraces platform differences. We use one codebase, but we also have tools that allow us to execute different code based on device. Everything is a widget. Pages are widgets which contain widgets. We write the code using the Flutter SDK. Flutter has an SDK that compiles the code down into native code for Android or IOS.
