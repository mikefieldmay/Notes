## React - Server Side Rendering

NextJs is a library that can alow you to server side render in React.
When you first visit the server it would typically ship you the index file and the code. 
This can be a problem if you need the website to be crawlable. For SSR the server will fetch and render the react app and then return the first page bundled with the React app.

Next.js is a package that can help with server side rendering. It enforces a strict folder structure so that all the routes are generated automatically.
